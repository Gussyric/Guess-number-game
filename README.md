# Guess-number-game
Welcome to the Guess Number Game! This simple yet engaging game allows you to test your luck against Python's random number generator. Try to guess the number Python is thinking of and see if you can outsmart the computer.

# How to Play
Run the program.
Enter your name when prompted. If you don't provide a name, you'll be called "PlayerOne" by default.
Guess which number Python is thinking of:
Type 1 for 1,
Type 2 for 2, or
Type 3 for 3.
Python will also make a random choice.
The game will declare the winner or let you know if Python won.
After each round, you'll have the option to play again (enter 'Y') or quit the game (enter 'Q').
